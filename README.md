# Art-Gallery-using-phpmyadmin-mysql-html-css
In this project we made an art gallery database in mysql with specific business rules the ERD for which is attached as well. The database was completed by using triggers and implementing Normalisation upto 3rd Normal Form. Hence, keeping the database as effiecient as possible for simple query execution.
Later the database was shifted to phpmyadmin and its connection was made to a php file which was included in the html page of the art gallery.
In this way a dynamic art gallery website was created. For initial testing stages we used xampp to link the website to a local host so it could be tested.
